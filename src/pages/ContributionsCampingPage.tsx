               Campsites increasingly resemble grassy car parks, wild camping is
               prohibited almost everywhere, even non-motorised, and bivouacking
               is a grey area that requires a good dose of courage and
               self-confidence.

               therefore absolutely taboo for any overnight adventure.

               About Wildcamping in Germany
            </Typography>
            <Typography className="mt-5">
               Wild camping is relatively confusing in Germany. The laws and
               guidelines vary depending on the federal state. Section 59 of the
               Federal Nature Conservation Act states that anyone is allowed to
               "enter the open countryside on roads and paths and on unused land
               for the purpose of recreation". This includes private roads,
               field margins, heathland, wasteland and fallow land as well as
               agricultural land outside the period of use. The period of use is
               the time between sowing and tillage. The right of access also
               includes the use of wheelchairs or bicycles on paths
            </Typography>
            <Typography className="mt-5">
               Access to the forest, on the other hand, is regulated by the
               Federal Forest Act. It is uniformly regulated that according to
               paragraph 14 "entering the forest for recreational purposes" is
               allowed - the federal states regulate the details. This also
               includes camping and spending the night outside designated
               campsites.
            </Typography>
            <Typography className="mt-5">
               Nature conservation areas, nature reserves, national parks and
               landscape conservation areas occupy a special position. In these
               areas, wild camping is usually strictly prohibited. Violations,
               especially other offences such as littering, can result in heavy
               fines. As a general rule, abide by local laws and treat nature
               with respect. It is also advisable to ask the owner for
               permission before spending the night on their property - a
               friendly request is usually well received!

            <Typography className="mt-5">
               If you want to play it safe in Germany and still spend the night
               as close to nature as possible, you can head for a campsite or
               ask the local forestry authority, but also the respective
               landowner. An emergency bivouac is usually allowed everywhere and
               planned bivouacking (spending the night outdoors without a tent)
               is usually tolerated for one night - with the exception of
               protected areas where overnight camping is expressly prohibited.

               dachgeber.de offers sleeping places by cyclists for cyclists!
               Dachgeber is based on the principle of reciprocity: you sleep at
               my place and I sleep at yours. Sympathetically old-fashioned:
               every year, either a printed booklet or a pdf file is published
               with a directory of over 3,000 places to stay in your house or as
               a campsite in your garden. Not a cool app, but a great,
               non-commercial and ADFC-affiliated project. Membership costs 15
               euros a year, 10 euros for ADFC members. Those arriving on foot
               or by train are also welcome by prior arrangement.

               based in Colorado, USA. Warmshowers is non-commercial and
