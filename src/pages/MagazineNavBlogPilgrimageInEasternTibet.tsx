                  The pilgrimage trail around the foot of the mountain is
                  considered one of the most impressive nature trails in the
                  world. No one could tell us if it was suitable for cycling. We
                  set out to find out and experienced unforgettable moments.

                  I have got used to using chopsticks when I eat. What I find
                  hard to get used to, though, are the duck heads that are
                  brought to the bubbling surface from time to time in our hot
                  pot, a kind of Chinese fondue. Between them and the various
                  offal floating around, I try to grab a few pieces of
                  vegetables or tofu to satisfy my vegetarian appetite. A real
                  challenge, I discover. When the next load of fish heads
                  disappears into the fiery red broth, I finally strike sail and
                  decide I've eaten enough for today. I spend the rest of the
                  evening drinking jasmine tea.

                  Together with three riders of the "Liteville Enduro Team
                  China", Kevin, Terryn and Arsenal, I am sitting here having
                  dinner in Shangri La. No, we have not discovered the
                  fictional, legendary Shangri La, made world famous by the
                  novel "The Lost Horizon" by James Hilton. We are sitting in a
                  small Chinese town in the province of Yunnan, which until 2001
                  still bore the name "Zhongdian", has about 130,00 inhabitants
                  and lies 3150m above sea level. The name had changed for
                  purely business reasons, in order to attract even more
                  tourists here now with the legendary name. Accordingly, the
                  old town has been lovingly renovated and is dotted with
                  hundreds of shops. All kinds of Tibetan souvenirs, from prayer
                  flags to singing bowls to yak jumpers, can be bought here.
                  There are also countless tea rooms offering local tea for
                  tasting and sale. They are also reminiscent of the old "Tea
                  Horse Road" that once ran along here. It was a network of old
                  trade routes. It was mainly used to transport "Pu Erh tea"
                  from the town of the same name to Lhasa on horseback.

                  We have also been travelling towards Tibet for two days.
                  Without horses, but with our mountain bikes in our luggage. We
                  have planned to ride the eastern part of a so-called Kora, a
                  pilgrimage route, around the mountain "Kawa Karpo". For the
                  Tibetans, the circumambulation of the mountain, which is
                  sacred to them, is a ritual act. For them, the mountain
                  represents the manifestation of the Buddha's spirit, and by
                  circling it many hope to come closer to this Buddha. In
                  special years of the Tibetan calendar, thousands of Buddhists
                  make a clockwise pilgrimage around the mountain.

                  We too are pilgrims on our way. At least, if you look at the
                  Latin root of the word. "Pilgrim" comes from the Latin word
                  peregrinus or peregrinari, "to be a stranger". And we feel
                  very much like strangers here. Certainly Kevin and I, who are
                  both from Germany, are even stranger than our two Chinese
                  friends, but even they only know the route ahead of us from
                  vague descriptions on the internet. Without them, we wouldn't
                  even be able to order the hot pot that is bubbling away here
                  in the restaurant. Chinese characters are like hieroglyphics
                  for us and indecipherable. Our knowledge of English doesn't
                  get us very far either. Most people in this region speak as
                  much English as we do Chinese, practically not a single word.
                  And so, more than once a day, we are happy to be on the road
                  in an internationally mixed team.

                  Another day in the minibus awaits us before we are finally
                  allowed to get on our bikes. We ride along the valley of the
                  Mekong. The flanks of the surrounding mountains rise steeply
                  from the wide river valley. Hour after hour passes. The next
                  stop is planned in Deqin. The city in the far north of Yunnan
                  province doesn't have much to offer at first, except a harsh
                  climate. For us, however, it is extremely important. It is the
                  last chance to buy food for the next few days. We also want to
                  meet a Tibetan here who will accompany us with his pack
                  horses.

                  Our driver skilfully drives the bus through the narrow streets
                  into a backyard and parks. In a restaurant we meet our
                  "Horseman". He greets us with shining eyes and a broad grin.
                  He has prepared three horses in his house and will pick us up
                  tomorrow morning by bus to drive the remaining kilometres
                  there, he announces. Lengthy negotiations begin about the
                  price for his services and the duration of the ride. Since we
                  don't know whether and how much we will be able to drive on
                  the way, or whether we might even have to push everything, we
                  want to give ourselves enough time. We plan seven days for the
                  tour. On the other side of the mountain range, our driver is
                  supposed to pick us up again by bus. He will drive all the way
                  back along the Mekong and then upstream in the Yangtze valley
                  back to the agreed meeting point. This will also take him four
                  days! The dimensions here are indescribably huge. After much
                  toing and froing, we arrange to meet at 8am the next morning.
                  We spend the night in Feilei Si, 10km away, a tourist village
                  at a higher altitude. The sleeping altitude of 3300m helps us
                  to get used to the thin air. Because on our route, the highest
                  pass with over 4500m is already waiting for us on the third
                  day. In order not to get altitude sickness, we have to get
                  used to the altitude slowly.
               </Typography>

               <Typography className="mt-5">
                  We also hope for good weather in the evening. From Feilei Si,
                  if the air is clear, we have a fantastic view of the 6740m
                  high Kawa Karpo, the sacred and highest mountain in Yunnan.
                  Unfortunately, the view does not materialise, the mountain
                  hides behind a thick cloud cover the whole evening. During
                  dinner we plan as far as possible what we want to buy
                  tomorrow. Rice, vegetables, a little meat and biscuits for the
                  road. Everyone is very excited about what awaits us. Will it
                  be rideable? Will we be able to cope with the altitude? What
                  will the weather be like? Will we sleep in our tents or in the
                  few camps along the way? Will our driver arrive on the other
                  side? Questions upon questions.

                  The next morning we go shopping at the huge market in Deqin.
                  Quite lost we stand there, because none of us has any idea how
                  much food we will need. We have noodle soup for breakfast,
                  biscuits and chocolate for lunch and rice and vegetables for
                  dinner. That's the meal plan. Well then, just don't buy too
                  little, starving on the road is not good. Especially not with
                  the effort. We carry our shopping in big white bags into the
                  small bus. Packed to the roof, there is not enough room for
                  all of us. So we get on our bicycles. The bus pulls up, the
                  goods are unloaded, then the driver collects us at the
                  roadside to get to the meeting point with the horses in a
                  small Tibetan mountain village. Down in the valley we passed
                  the border into eastern Tibet, visible only through a sparsely
                  staffed checkpoint in a tiny tent on the side of the road. The
                  officials only briefly checked our identity cards and
                  otherwise showed no interest in us.

                  The luggage is weighed, distributed among the horses and we
                  pack our daypacks. We need four horses now with all the feed,
                  otherwise the load will be too heavy for the animals. Before
                  we are allowed to start, we have to "sign" an agreement about
                  the service and payment. This is not done with pen and
                  signature, but with ink pad and fingerprint. Only when there
                  are four red fingerprints on the paper are we allowed to
                  start. A steep gravel road leads us up to 3200m, our first
                  crossing. Here the road ends and the tension increases
                  immeasurably. What awaits us around the first bend? Driving?
                  Push? Or even carry it downhill?

                  Our "Horseman" is saying goodbye to us. He will not go on the
                  tour with us. His wife and a relative accompany us with the
                  horses. They have already gone ahead and want to wait for us
                  at the first camp. From now on we are on our own, with no
                  phone reception, no internet and no contact with the outside
                  world. We have to carry everything we need ourselves and help
                  ourselves if something happens. An altitude profile and an
                  inaccurate digital map are all we have for orientation.
                  According to this, however, there is only one way over the
                  mountains.

                  We clap off, pedal away and already we are immersed in a
                  completely different world. Like a roller coaster, the path
                  winds down into the forest in a tunnel of prayer flags.
                  Thousands of them hang waving in bright colours to the right
                  and left at the edge of the roughly 50 cm wide, smoothly
                  trampled path. It feels like racing through a paint box at
                  high speed. As if you had pressed a reset button in your head
                  and switched to "now and here". The feelings roll over. Only
                  after what feels like an eternity do we stop for a moment. All
                  four of us are beaming like honey cakes, fall into each
                  other's arms and can hardly express our joy. Supernatural is
                  the only word we can agree on to describe this path. It is the
                  most impressive thing we have ever ridden. If it continues

                  We catch up with the horses at a half-ruined wooden hut in the
                  dense forest. It is already dark. This is our campsite. A
                  campfire burns in a shelter. Kitchen and recreation room are
                  combined here. A stream babbles behind the hut. A few upright
                  tree trunks are covered with plastic sheets and are our
                  bedroom. Old mattresses and damp blankets lie on wooden
                  platforms. We lay our sleeping bags over them. Our Tibetan
                  companions cook together with us. None of us can pronounce
                  their Tibetan names, so we christen them Annemarie and Hans,
                  which they obviously enjoy. Big laughter on the first evening
                  of a trip with new companions is a good sign for a relaxed

                  The next morning we sit around the campfire with noodle soup
                  and rice. We will probably have to get used to that in the
                  next few days. Arsenal nibbles with relish on dried chicken
                  legs he brought back from the market. Outside it is raining
                  lightly. Here at almost 3000m, dense forest grows around us.
                  Astonished, we look at the diversity of species, which we did
                  not expect up here. After breakfast, we start on a muddy path
                  littered with slippery stones, often almost completely
                  swallowed up by the dense vegetation. A complete contrast to
                  yesterday. Again and again we try to ride small pieces, which
                  rarely succeeds. Along the path are a few abandoned wooden
                  barracks, evidence that thousands of pilgrims used to travel
                  here in some years. Now they have fallen into disrepair and

                  last 250m are so steep that we have to carry the bikes. Again
                  thousands of prayer flags line the path. Halfway up, various
                  Buddha figures are carved into a rock face and colourfully
                  painted. It feels like we are crossing a sacred place. After
                  eight hours we reach some small wooden huts. We see our horses
                  and have finally made it. The bed camp is a bit cleaner and
                  bigger. Otherwise, the camps are all very similar. A fireplace
                  with wooden benches at knee height to sit on and a "dormitory"
                  covered with tarpaulins. Annemarie and Hans have been here for
                  a long time and have prepared rice and vegetables for us by
                  the fire. Exhausted and grateful, we help ourselves. Sated, we
                  linger only briefly around the campfire. Tomorrow will be a
                  long day, the highest pass awaits us. So we crawl into our

                  find a rhythm. The air gets thinner and thinner and we breathe
                  heavily. The altitude was already getting to us yesterday and
                  the pace was noticeably reduced. Driving is once again out of
                  the question, the path to the soon visible pass is too steep.

                  before we reach the highest point, garlands of prayer flags
                  begin to show us the way. The rain lets up a little and we
                  drag ourselves, breathing heavily, across a carpet of
                  colourful fabric flags. The ground is no longer visible,
                  everything is covered with billions of "wind horses", the
                  correct translation from Tibetan for the flags. The mountains
                  are rugged and covered in clouds. 4500m my GPS device shows
                  here at the "Duokha La". The highest point of our pilgrimage
                  has been reached!

                  A dull rumble accompanies the jet-black clouds and reminds us
                  to get going. We push our way down the slippery carpet of
                  prayer flags for the first few metres until we reach rocky
                  ground. We look down into a deep valley. Far below we
                  recognise a green meadow with a stream between the steep rock
                  faces. A demanding path leads there, which requires full
                  concentration with over 100 serpentines and saps our strength.
                  The thunderstorm has passed and when we arrive at the bottom,
                  the sun is shining. We park the bikes and ourselves on the
                  meadow and treat ourselves to some biscuits. We look back to
                  the top of the pass and see the impressive descent ahead of
                  us. Exhausted but happy, we enjoy the view before we roll the
                  last half hour to the campsite.

                  The next morning we find it hard to get out of our sleeping
                  bags, yesterday is still in our bones. But already the first
                  metres behind the camp give us hope for a fantastic day of
                  driving. The road is as flat as on the first day and invites
                  us to top speeds. It feels good to finally feel the wind
                  again. This continues until we enter the forest again. Here it
                  immediately becomes blocked and slippery. A group of Tibetan
                  pilgrims, accompanied by a monk in red-orange robes, passes
                  by. After spotting us, he walks directly towards us. Friendly
                  with a "Taschi Delek", the Tibetan "hello", he greets us. We
                  don't understand a word, but we manage to communicate with
                  hands and feet. He shows great interest in our bikes and can
                  hardly believe that we came over the pass with them. We are
                  amazed when he pulls out a golden smartphone from under his
                  cape and wants to take photos with us. Of course, we gladly do
                  him the favour and also take souvenir photos of the friendly
                  encounter. We spend the afternoon pushing again until we reach
                  our camp.

                  The fourth morning on our tour begins as usual with noodle
                  soup and tea. We crave coffee and bread with jam. Renunciation
                  is certainly part of the journey. We may not only give up
                  familiar foods, but also distractions like the telephone and
                  the internet. We haven't missed the achievements of the
                  digital age for a minute. There is always something to do. And
                  how nice it is to be able to talk without someone constantly
                  typing on their smartphone and being distracted. At the
                  beginning, the path leads along the rushing stream. Slowly but
                  steadily, the path climbs and leads to a small hill. This is
                  also decorated with thousands of prayer flags. Hundreds of
                  food bowls are also piled up here, probably left behind as
                  offerings. Next to them, various pieces of clothing are also
                  lying together in a small pile. It makes a less sacred
                  impression on us. It is more reminiscent of a rubbish dump.

               <Typography className="mt-5">
                  The path zigzags steeply downwards. Our hairpin technique is
                  once again put to the test. The forest thins out and we come
                  to a raging river. Somewhat surprised by the scenery, we cross
                  a bridge and follow the path downstream. Our surprise is even
                  greater when we see a house standing on the side of the path,
                  the first one in five days. And indeed we have a camp for
                  ourselves here on the second floor. After the days in damp and
                  shabby wooden barracks, we enjoy the unexpectedly clean
                  change. Up to here, we have not met more than 20 people in the
                  last few days. Around the small dwelling there are about as
                  many. In the basement there is a small grocery shop where we
                  can buy the bare necessities. Colourfully decorated motorbikes
                  with huge loudspeakers are used to transport the goods. On
                  them, tired pilgrims can also make their way to the road over
                  the last pass. Of course, accompanied by Chinese folk music at
                  a deafening volume. Hope germinates in us for a road that is
                  passable throughout.

                  We help load the horses in the morning and start together. At
                  the beginning we are faster with the bikes, but that changes
                  after a few kilometres. The path is soon too steep to ride it
                  without motor assistance, so we descend. Today we want to
                  climb more than 1000 metres uphill again. And from the looks
                  of it, we will probably push 100% of it. For hours,
                  monotonously, one foot in front of the other. In between, the
                  bikes really become a burden. A board stand with cold drinks
                  offers a little change. We order a Coke and take a short
                  break. Loud music comes from the forest and announces a few
                  motorbikes. Secretly, each of us probably wishes for an engine
                  to go with his bike. After almost four hours we reach the last
                  pass without having ridden a single metre. We are still
                  thrilled by the colourful flags that also adorn the highest
                  point here. The view reaches back over the stages of the last
                  two days. We are relieved. Until Abingcun, the village where
                  we have to meet our driver, it is all downhill. The landscape
                  changes completely. It is dry as dust and hot. The dense
                  forest has turned into sparse, lonely pines. But the trail is
                  just as good as the first day and puts exhausted smiles on our
                  faces.

                  On a ridge lies our last camp. We have been looking forward to
                  washing ourselves all day. Wrong, there is no water up here.
                  It has to be brought from the valley on motorbikes and is used
                  exclusively for cooking. Dinner is also meagre. Our supplies
                  are pretty much exhausted and so we have dry rice with leeks.
                  There is nothing left from our shopping at the market. Behind
                  the hut is a large prayer wheel. As the sun sets, we turn it
                  devoutly, striking a bell with each revolution and a bright
                  "clang" resounds across the otherwise completely silent
                  landscape into the distance. Almost wistfully, we sit together
                  around the campfire for the last time and review the
                  experiences of the past days. We have been preparing for over
                  a year and now the journey is soon over.

                  The trail on the last day is again a highlight. Dusty, but
                  made for biking. We rush through the light trees from the
                  mountains to Abincun. After seven days in seclusion, we slowly
                  return to civilisation. After about three hours by bus, we
                  reach the first larger town and immediately storm a
                  restaurant.

                  After Terryn and Arsenal have made the choice for all of us,
                  we toast to the successful tour. Afterwards, silence descends.
                  This time it is not pleasurable and sublime, as so often on
                  the last evenings, but digital in nature. There is reception
                  again and so we read emails, look for the latest news and send
                  reports to those at home. Only when the food is brought to the
                  table is everyone fully awake again. It is very convenient
                  that there are lots of vegetables and potatoes to choose from
                  and this time there are no duck heads on the plates.
