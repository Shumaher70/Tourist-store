          THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DYECOSHELL™ FABRIC BEGAN WITH TWO QUESTIONS:
        </Typography>
        <Typography className="text-black font-bold my-1">
          1) WHAT FABRIC DO WE WANT TO USE FOR OUR TRANSIT LINE?
        </Typography>
        <Typography className="text-black font-bold my-1">
          2) HOW WILL WE APPROACH THE ASPECT OF SUSTAINABILITY IN THE FUTURE?
        </Typography>
        It quickly became clear to us that we could not simply take a fabric off
        the shelf to achieve our goals. Instead, we invested more time and
        energy in the - fundamental - development of a fabric concept. Our goal
        was not "just" to find a solution for the product line, but also to have
        an approach that would define our view on fabrics in general. When
        defining the requirements for this particular fabric, both durability
        and sustainability crystallised as the most important factors to
        consider.
        <Typography className="text-black font-bold my-1">
          DURABILITY
        </Typography>
        For us, durability means that all materials used are of the same [high]
        quality. This is especially true for wear parts such as zips and
        fabrics, which have to withstand heavy use over many years without
        losing their aesthetic value or functionality. For the fabrics, abrasion
        resistance was the most important aspect for us.
        <Typography className="text-black font-bold my-1">
          SUSTAINABILITY
        </Typography>
        As for sustainability, unfortunately the brief was not so clear. We
        contacted our fabric suppliers (and even found new ones) to discuss the
        issue of sustainable fabrics that would meet our requirements. We met
        with people who specialise in different recycling methods and at the
        same time researched abrasion resistant fabrics, hoping to find one that
        combined both aspects. We came across some interesting approaches, but
        the lack of transparency of most recycling methods didn't quite convince
        us yet. For example, recycling PET bottles wastes a lot of energy and
        the resulting polyester fabrics do not offer the same durability as a
        piece of pure polyester fabric, especially for backpacks. Recycling
        fishing nets, carpets and other waste is similarly arduous and often
        other plastics such as polyethylene and polypropylene are found in the
        mix. Different fibre lengths and molecular differences make recycling
        from different sources even more difficult. Some manufacturers also
        admit that the recycled material is often not as resilient as its
        counterpart made from new granules. Even though the processes are
        constantly being improved, the results are hardly equivalent: recycled
        materials often cost much more and are not as durable as the original
        material. That means you get less for a higher price.
        <Typography className="text-black font-bold my-1">
          WE BELIEVE IN LONG-TERM RECYCLING
        </Typography>
        We believe that recycling is an irreplaceable element of a truly
        sustainable product life cycle and we will continue to work on
        integrating it into our future developments. At the moment, we believe
        that using less but better fabrics to produce products is the right way
        for us. Therefore, we have been looking for extremely durable and
        abrasion resistant fibres and for this purpose we have tested different
        fabrics that are considered to be very durable and resistant. All these
        findings finally defined the standard for our base material. We wanted
        to be more abrasion resistant than anything we have used before,
        including fabrics used by military and law enforcement agencies around
        the world. No easy task. <br />
        In several trials we have combined Nylon 6.6 with UHMWPE
        (Ultra-High-Molecular-Weight Polyethylene), which has incredible tensile
        strength and is often used for extremely tear-resistant products. We
        made countless attempts to combine the two but never got past a certain
        point and the high use of the material was disproportionate to the
        improvement in abrasion resistance. Up to this point, we have found that
        combining different materials is a difficult task (above a certain
        thread thickness), even when we have conducted over 100 different
        abrasion tests with fabric blends made especially for us. However, the
        most promising was a specially treated and twisted nylon thread that is
        tightly woven and has a special coating that is waterproof to the fabric
        but leaves its freedom of movement.
        <br />
        The result was a robust fabric that (finally) met our abrasion
        resistance requirements but was still soft enough to avoid abrasion
        spikes outside the lab and comfortable to the touch. As the nylon
        recycling process proved to be very energy and resource intensive, we
        looked for other ways to reduce the initial footprint of new fabrics.
        Again, we asked around to different manufacturers and one process caught
        our attention: DOPE DYEING.
        <br />

          WHAT IS SPIN DYEING?
        </Typography>
        Dope dyeing is a process that simply omits the dyeing of fabrics with
        chemicals and water. After weaving, normal fabrics are exposed to
        different liquid substances depending on their colour. The dyeing
        process alone consumes about 89% of the water used for the entire fabric
        production. The same applies to energy consumption (60%), CO² emissions
        (65%) and chemical consumption (63%). This makes regular dyeing by far
        the most resource-intensive and environmentally damaging part of the
        entire fabric production process. As with conventionally produced
        fabrics, the raw material is processed in granule form and extruded
        under heat. The result is a single thin continuous filament. This is the
        basis for each yarn, and a different number of filaments spun together
        results in yarns of varying thickness. Normally these filaments are
        transparent to white and give a kind of "off white", also called
        "greige".
        <br />
        With DOPE DYEING, the colourless granulate is mixed with a coloured
        granulate before extrusion so that the filament is extruded directly in
        the previously defined colour. During weaving, the already coloured
        yarns are then woven into a fabric - without any dyeing at all. In our
        case, we chose two slightly differently coloured yarns, Black and Castle
        Rock Grey, so that the product not only visualises the principle of DOPE
        DYEING, but also brings a depth of colour to the fabric that cannot be
        achieved with regularly dyed mono-materials. DOPE DYEING has another
        major advantage. A popular example is the comparison between a carrot
        and a radish. The radish has only one coloured Flysheet, while the
        carrot is orange all the way into the core. This is also the case with
        DOPE DYEING, where the thread is coloured through - just like a carrot.
        This also makes it extremely resistant to fading and discolouration from
        abrasion and UV light. The same process is also used for carpets, which
        would otherwise fade very quickly due to the high abrasion to which they
        are exposed

          THE FINAL STEPS
        </Typography>
        <br />
        In line with our plan for 2018, we have now further improved the
        composition of the base material and added another version to our fabric
        range, which we have named DYECOSHELL™: DYECOSHELL™. The improved
        version of the original fabric is called DYECOShell I and is now made of
        840D nylon x 660D nylon, 100% dope dyed, 3xPU coated (inside) + DWR (C6)
        coating (outside). It is accompanied by a lighter version, which we call
        DYECOShell II and which contains the same ingredients: 420D nylon x 330D
        nylon, 100% warp-dyed, 3xPU coated (inside) + DWR (C6) coating
        (outside).
        <br />
        At the moment, both fabrics are available in two (yarn) colour
        combinations. The original is Black/Castlerock to show the difference in
        production, and the second and newest is Black/Black - well, because we
        like All Black. We will continue to add other colour combinations,
        despite the obstacles of the dyeing process. DYECOSHELL™ fabrics will
        continue to evolve and gradually expand the portfolio. With new
        materials, different coatings and modern techniques, we will make our
        products more durable and sustainable without giving up our aesthetic
        signature.
        <br />
        In addition to the DYECOSHELL™ fabrics, we are gradually replacing our
        normal fabrics with dope dyed fabrics. For example, the lining of the
        entire Transit Line is made of dope dyed polyester. We are aware that we
        have not yet exhausted all possibilities and that there is still a lot
        to do, especially when it comes to sustainability, but we will
        constantly look at new recycling methods and resource-saving production
        processes and seek improvements.
